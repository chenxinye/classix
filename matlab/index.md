There are various ways to run CLASSIX in MATLAB and this folder contains several files demonstrating this.

If you are new to CLASSIX, start with README.mlx or README.html.

**Acknowledgements:** We are grateful to Mike Croucher and Maria Gavilan-Alfonso from MathWorks who have assisted us with enabling CLASSIX for MATLAB users, and have also directly contributed to several files in this repo.
